<h2>You're trying to create new users or create new polls without logging in. Please go back and log in FIRST.</h2>

<h2> or perhaps you're trying to log out when you've never logged in! </h2>

<h2> or perhaps you're trying to create users but you're not an administrator. You're out of luck </h2>

<h2> or perhaps you're trying to delete a poll that you do not own </h2>

Or perhaps I messed up somewhere..that is always a possibility.
